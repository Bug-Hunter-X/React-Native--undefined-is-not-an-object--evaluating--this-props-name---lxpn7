The solution is to access props and state within lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` that guarantee the component has been rendered and has access to its props and state.

```javascript
// Correct:
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {name: null};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log(this.props.name); // Access props after component is mounted
    this.setState({ name: this.props.name });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <View>
          <Text>{this.state.name}</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```
By accessing `this.props.name` inside `componentDidMount`, we ensure the component is fully mounted and the props are available.  If you need to use the props or state immediately, you can set default values in the state within the constructor.  Using this technique avoids the undefined error and makes your component more reliable.
